The rapidly evolving digital landscape is characterized by the continuous creation, testing, deployment, and operation of software applications and digital workloads. This constant activity comes at an environmental cost: every step consumes substantial energy, leading to a growing carbon footprint and the accelerated depletion of resources. Sustainable computing practices are crucial for reducing the environmental impact of this cycle, especially as climate concerns rise and resources become increasingly limited. Energy monitoring tools are critical for understanding and optimizing energy usage within the digital world, directly contributing to the mitigation of climate impacts and the conservation of finite resources.

The Energy Monitoring Tool (EMT) is an open-source solution for collecting granular, real-time energy consumption data. It enhances energy observability, enabling users to identify hotspots and optimize resource utilization for sustainability and cost efficiency. This capability is becoming increasingly important, especially as large machine learning (ML) models become widely available and extensively used.The rapid growth of ML is driving unprecedented demand for computational resources. Training large models, fine tuning them for specific tasks, and running continuous inference all require significant processing power and infrastructure. 

As infrastructure needs expand, sustainable computing becomes ever more essential. EMT support this by providing granular (process-level) insights, these insights allow for proactive identification of energy inefficiencies, facilitating targeted optimizations that reduce both environmental impact and operational costs.
