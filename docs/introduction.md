# Introduction to the Energy Monitoring Tool (EMT)

## Purpose and Vision

EMT addresses the growing need for energy observability in modern computing, aligning with Green IT principles for sustainable practices. It provides accurate energy insights to help organizations make environmentally responsible decisions.

## Core Features and Design Principles

- Detailed documentation and architecture
- Per-process energy estimation
- Prometheus-based telemetry
- Focus on virtualization (containers, cgroups, VMs)

While tools like PowerAPI and Scaphandre offer modularity or lightweight agents, EMT distinguishes itself by combining deep kernel-level integration (eBPF), advanced attribution models, and a commitment to reliable virtualization support, making it especially suitable for modern, cloud-native, and virtualized environments.
