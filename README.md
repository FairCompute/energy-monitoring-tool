# Energy Monitoring Tool (EMT) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FairCompute/energy-monitoring-tool/refs/heads/main/assets/logo.png" alt="EMT Logo" width="60"/>

**EMT** is a lightweight, Python-based tool that tracks the energy consumption of applications with process-level granularity. Designed with a strong focus on machine learning, it enables monitoring of the energy usage of training and inference for large deep learning models across diverse computing environments. EMT is framework-agnostic and generates process-level energy consumption log. The repository provides concrete examples of how to track energy consumption in various scenarios. EMT simplifies and democratizes energy monitoring, enabling developers and operations teams to actively reduce the environmental footprint thus advancing digital sustainability initiatives. 


## 🚀 Features

- Real-time energy utilization tracking.
- Device-level breakdown of energy consumption.
- Enegy/Power attribution to a process of interest in a multi-process shared resource setting.
- Modular and extendable software architecture, currently supports following powergroups:
  - CPU(s) with RAPL capabilites.
  - Nvidia GPUs.
- Visualization interface for energy data using TensorBoard,  making it easy to analyze energy usage trends.

  #### Supported Platforms
  - Linux
  

> Road Map
> - Environmentally conscious coding tips.
> - Virtual CPU(s) covered by Teads dataset.
> - Add support for Windows through PCM/OpenHardwareMonitor

## 🌍 Why EMT?

In the era of climate awareness, it's essential for developers to contribute to a sustainable future. EMT Tool empowers you to make informed decisions about your code's impact on the environment and take steps towards writing more energy-efficient software.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
Install the latest [EMT package](https://pypi.org/project/emt/)  from the Python Package Index (PyPI):  

``` bash
pip install emt

# verify installation and the version
python -m emt --version
```





### _Usage_:

> We currently plan to support three modes of usage: Python Context Managers, Keras Callbacks and CLI.
> The _callbacks_ focus on working with popular ML library Keras, the python _context manager_ mode can
> be easily integrated into any python code, while the _CLI_ mode allows usage of the tool for
> command-line application that are not writtern in python.  
> **Only Python Context Manager Mode is implemented so far!**

#### Using Python Context Managers

```python
import logging
import torch
import emt
from emt import EnergyMonitor

emt.setup_logger(
    log_dir="./logs/example/",
)

# Dummy function
def add_tensors_gpu():
    device = torch.device(device if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    # Generate random data
    a = torch.randint(1, 100, (1000,), dtype=torch.int32, device=device)
    b = torch.randint(1, 100, (1000,), dtype=torch.int32, device=device)

    return a + b

# Create a context manager
with EnergyMonitor as monitor:
    add_tensors_gpu()

print(f"energy consumption: {monitor.total_consumed_energy:.2f} J")
print(f"energy consumption: {monitor.consumed_energy}")
```

## ⚙️ Methodology

The EMT context manager spawns a separate thread to monitor energy usage for CPUs and GPUs at regular intervals. It also tracks the utilization of these resources by the monitored process. EMT then estimates the process's share of the total energy consumption by proportionally assigning energy usage based on the resource utilization of the process.
