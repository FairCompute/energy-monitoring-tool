# Energy Monitoring Tool (EMT) <img src="logo.png" alt="EMT Logo" width="60"/>
EMT is a handy tool that helps you track your code‚Äôs energy consumption. As developers, being mindful of the environmental impact of our software is important. EMT makes it easy to monitor and optimize how much energy your code uses, helping you build more eco-friendly applications.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time energy utilization tracking.
- Device-level breakdown of energy consumption.
- Enegy/Power attribution to a process of interest in a multi-process shared resource setting.
- Modular and extendable software architecture, currently supports following powergroups:
   - CPU(s) with RAPL capabilites.
   - Nvidia GPUs.

   #### Supported Platforms
  -  Linux

> Future Releases:
  >   - Visualizations to identify energy-intensive processes. 
  >   - Environmentally conscious coding tips.
  >   - Virtual CPU(s) covered by Teads dataset.
  >   - Add support for Windows through PCM


## üåç Why EMT?

In the era of climate awareness, it's essential for developers to contribute to a sustainable future. EMT Tool empowers you to make informed decisions about your code's impact on the environment and take steps towards writing more energy-efficient software.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:philips-internal/energy-monitoring-tool.git`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```shell
   cd energy-monitoring-tool
   pip install .
   ````

That's it! You're now ready to analyze the energy footprint of your code.
###  *Usage*:
>We currently plan to support three modes of usage: Python Context Managers,  Keras Callbacks and CLI.
>The *callbacks* focus on working with popular ML library Keras, the python *context manager* mode can
>be easily integrated into any python code, while the *CLI* mode allows usage of the tool for 
> command-line application that are not writtern in python.  
> **Only Python Context Manager Mode is implemented so far!**

#### Using Python Context Managers
```python
import emt
import tensorflow as tf
from emt import EnergyMetering

# setup logging
emt.setup_logger(Path(Path(), 'emt.log‚Äô))

def foo(device='gpu'): 
¬† ¬† with tf.device(device):
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # perform tensor operations.
        ‚Ä¶

# Create an EnerrgyMeterting Context.
# Energy consumption of the function(s) is
# recorded when called within the context.
with EnergyMetering() as metering:
¬† ¬† results = foo()

# report energy at some later time.
energy = metering.consumed_energy()
 
```
